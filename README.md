# Djikstra-Algorithm
Djikstra algoritm for beginners

This will take in an undirected graph file. The file need to have three fields, first two are the nodes, and the last field is the vertices.
Example:

graph1.txt

A B 9
A C 10
C D 19

No need to repeat the vertices.

The program will ask for two inputs, a beginning node and the ending node.
The output will be the shortest path between the two nodes.

Usage:
  go run main.go ./graph1.txt
