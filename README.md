# Djikstra-Algorithm
Usage:
  go run main.go ./graphfile
 
graph file:
  undirected graph with three fields, first and second column are the nodes, and the third field is the vertices number
  example,
  
  A B 9
  A C 10
  C D 19
  
  it's an undirected graph so no need to repeat vertices like B A 9, C A 10, D C 19.
